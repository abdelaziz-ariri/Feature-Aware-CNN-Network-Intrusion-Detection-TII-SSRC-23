# Feature-Aware-CNN-Network-Intrusion-Detection-TII-SSRC-23
This project implements feature-aware CNN architectures for network intrusion detection using the TII-SSRC-23 dataset. It evaluates baseline CNN, FWM-CNN, and SWCC-CNN models for binary, multiclass, and subtype traffic classification, highlighting improved performance with feature weighting and correlation.
